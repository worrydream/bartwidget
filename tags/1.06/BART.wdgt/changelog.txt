-----------------------
 - Click the speaker button for voice announcements on the 
   currently-displayed route.

 - The trip area automatically scales horizontally, so long trips
   don't run off the end of the widget.
   
 - The time/date bar stays in sync when you drag or scroll the
   trip area.
   
 - Map baubles shrink when you drag them, so it's easier to see
   the map.

 - Fares and holiday schedules are updated.  Profuse thanks to
   Michael Andersen, Annie Madej, and Jeff Baker for updating
   the fare tables for me.


v0.94:  September 13, 2005
--------------------------
 - The widget has been updated to reflect BART's new schedule.

 - Let voice announcements guide you to and from work every day.
   Click the "speaker" button next to a bookmark, and then click
   the words in red to change them.

-----------------------
 - Bookmark the current route by clicking the "heart" button.

 - Trips that disallow bikes are displayed with a "no bikes" icon.

---------------------
 - At the request of BART's legal department, the BART logo and the
   official BART map have been removed.

   When the map area is open, click the (x) in the lower-left to 
   select your favorite map.

 - Use up and down arrow keys to scroll through trips.


v0.91:  July 3, 2005
--------------------
 - Select a specific date and time to plan around, via the clock button
   in the lower-left corner.

   hit tightly-spaced stations.

 - The widget checks for an updated version every few days, instead of 
   just when first loaded.
